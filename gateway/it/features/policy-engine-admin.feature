Feature: Policy Engine Admin API
  As a gateway administrator
  I want to access the policy engine admin API
  So that I can inspect the current configuration and debug issues

  Background:
    Given the gateway services are running
    And I authenticate using basic auth as "admin"

  # ============================================================
  # Basic Endpoint Tests
  # ============================================================

  Scenario: Config dump endpoint returns valid JSON
    When I send a GET request to the policy-engine config dump endpoint
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response Content-Type should be "application/json"
    And the response should be valid JSON

  Scenario: Config dump contains policy registry section
    When I send a GET request to the policy-engine config dump endpoint
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response JSON should have key "policy_registry"
    And the response JSON at "policy_registry" should have key "total_policies"
    And the response JSON at "policy_registry" should have key "policies"

  Scenario: Config dump contains routes section
    When I send a GET request to the policy-engine config dump endpoint
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response JSON should have key "routes"
    And the response JSON at "routes" should have key "total_routes"
    And the response JSON at "routes" should have key "route_configs"

  Scenario: Config dump contains lazy resources section
    When I send a GET request to the policy-engine config dump endpoint
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response JSON should have key "lazy_resources"
    And the response JSON at "lazy_resources" should have key "total_resources"

  # ============================================================
  # Route Configuration Tests
  # ============================================================

  Scenario: Config dump reflects deployed API routes
    Given I deploy a test API with the following configuration:

    And the config dump should contain route with basePath "/admin-test/v1"
