Feature: JSON Schema Guardrail Policy
  Test the json-schema-guardrail policy which validates request and response payloads
  against JSON Schema specifications, supports JSONPath extraction, inverted logic,
  and detailed error reporting.

  Background:
    Given the gateway services are running
    And I authenticate using basic auth as "admin"
